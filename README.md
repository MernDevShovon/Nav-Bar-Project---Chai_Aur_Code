# Nav-Bar-Project---Chai_Aur_Code

Hey there! 👋

I'm a student of Chai Aur Code 🧑‍💻, diving into the world of coding and building cool projects. This repository is a place where I practice what I learn from the theory lectures and document my journey. It's all about experimenting, exploring, and growing as I learn new things.

Stay tuned for more updates as I continue to develop and refine my skills! 🚀
